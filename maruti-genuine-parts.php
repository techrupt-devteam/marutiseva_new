	<p>How do you keep your favourite car in the same shape, just the way it was created? How do you keep it 100% Maruti Suzuki, from the smallest nut to an all-important axle? In your Maruti Suzuki, over 20,000 parts come together and work in perfect harmony. Each part is factory-fitted, conforming to our quality standards. In due course, wear and tear and consequent replacement and repair happen. Maruti Genuine Parts ensure that your car remains like the original, down to the smallest part. We have a huge network of Maruti Suzuki dealers and Maruti Suzuki service stations across the nation, there to help you with genuine spare parts.</p>

<p>Each part is checked for quality, re-checked and then checked once more. Only then will our engineers clear a part for sale to you. In fact, we often conduct quality inspections at our vendor units also. All to ensure that you get parts just like the original. Whether you are buying a new Maruti Suzuki car or a used car, the quality standards are always met. Maruti Genuine Parts are easily available through our nationwide network of dealer workshops, service stations, Maruti Genuine Parts distributors and retail outlets at reasonable prices, which further adds to the joy of owning and driving a Maruti Suzuki.</p>
