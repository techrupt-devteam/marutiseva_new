<p>Seva, made its debut way back in 1985 at dwarka, nashik. It has played a major role in the revolution brought about by maruti, specifically when suzuki had launched "Maruti 800" in I 983 which was specially designed for indian roads.  Seva further expanded its horizons by setting up new facilities at midc ambad in 1990. </p>

<p>Keeping up with times, the infrastructure at seva nashik is fully equipped with latest state of the art 3s facilities (sales, service and spares) spread over a area of around 44,000 sq.Ft. Encouraged by the devastating customer response, seva extended it's roots also at nanded in the year 1990, nagpur in the year 1993 and then in dhulia in early 2004. </p>
